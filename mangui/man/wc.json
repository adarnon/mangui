By default, grep prints the\nmatching lines.\nIn  addition,  three  variant  programs  egrep,  fgrep  and  rgrep  are\navailable.   egrep  is  the  same  as  grep -E.   fgrep  is the same as\ngrep -F.  rgrep is the same as grep -r.  Direct  invocation  as  either\negrep  or  fgrep  is  deprecated,  but  is provided to allow historical\napplications that rely on them to run unmodified.",
